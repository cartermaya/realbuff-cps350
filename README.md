This was my submission for the first project for CPS 350 at the University of Dayton. This project built off of the first two assignments, which were focused on implementing a Java class for buffers of double numbers, kept in a partially filled array. 

The required methods for the class were:
  1. A method to append a value to the buffer, which returns false if the buffer is already full.
  2. A method to insert a value to a given position to the buffer, which returns false if the buffer is already full.
  3. A method to delete a value in a given position from the buffer, which returns false if the buffer has no values.
  4. A method to display all valid elements in the buffer.
  5. A method to sort the valid elements in the buffer using insertion sort.
  6. A method to sort the valid elements in the buffer using merge sort.
  7. A method to sort the valid elements in the buffer using quick sort.
